# Welcome to Handelit!
**a project by The Dexteriteers created for natIgnite 2025!**

## Project info
Fine motor decline from aging, stroke, arthritis, or neurodegenerative conditions impacts millions of older adults, making tasks like drinking tea, opening containers, or getting dressed difficult or impossible. In long-term care (LTC) settings, fine motor rehab is deprioritized in favor of urgent safety issues, while rehab professionals face growing caseloads and limited time. Without consistent rehab, older adult independence declines quickly, leading to higher care costs and reduced quality of life. Our solution is a computer visionâ€“based rehab platform enabling older adults to independently practice functional fine motor activities. The system delivers real-time adaptive feedback, accessible audio guidance, and gamified challenges, all without requiring constant therapist oversight. Data is securely stored and easily shared with care teams for monitoring progress through effective dashboards.
